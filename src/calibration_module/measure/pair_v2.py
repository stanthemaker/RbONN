"""Step 6 v2 acquisition -- drive one pair's schedule, return rows.

This half touches the instruments and does no fitting.  It hands back the raw
``(repeat, x, w, mean_v, std_v)`` rows that
:func:`calibration_module.fit.pair_v2.average_levels` turns into levels, so the
offline script and the GUI collect data through exactly one implementation and
differ only in what they do with the rows afterwards.

``monitor`` is anything with the ``monitor_cycle(timeout=..., single=...)``
protocol -- a :class:`~daq_module.DAQController` in every current caller.  The
near-rail escalation additionally wants ``last_values`` and the ``_settings``
the controller was configured with; a monitor without them still measures, with
autoranging skipped and said so once, rather than failing.
