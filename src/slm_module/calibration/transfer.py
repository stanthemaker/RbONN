"""The fitted sin^2 transfer curve -- the encoder's model of one channel.

A grayscale level ``L`` sets an LC retardance ``Delta(L)``, and an amplitude
modulator between polarizers passes::

    I(L) = floor + contrast * sin(Delta(L) / 2)^2
    Delta(L) = phase_curv * L^2 + phase_slope * L + phase_offset

Five parameters per channel.  ``floor`` is the extinction leak the panel cannot
close, ``contrast`` the swing above it, and ``Delta`` is quadratic in level
because the panel's phase response measurably is (see "Why a curvature term").

``phase_curv = 0`` recovers the original 4-parameter linear model exactly, and
that is what every fit stored before this term existed loads back as -- so the
extra parameter costs nothing in compatibility.  Note that with a curvature
term ``phase_slope`` is only the *linear coefficient*, no longer "the slope":
the local rate is ``phase_rate(L) = 2*phase_curv*L + phase_slope``.

Why fit at all
--------------
:meth:`slm_module.encoding.EncodingChannel.level_for` used to invert the
*measured* Step-3b curve point by point.  Three problems, all visible in the
0903 calibration:

1. **``v = 1`` was defined by ``argmax``.**  One noisy sample redefines full
   scale.  Between the 0828 and 0903 calibrations of the same ten channels the
   argmax peak moved by 45 levels rms -- and by 120 levels on one channel, where
   a single +6% spike at level 770 sat 9 swept levels below the real peak.  The
   fitted ``Delta = pi`` point moved 17.7 levels rms, and 10 on that channel.
2. **Every point carried the sweep's single-shot noise.**  The 4-parameter fit
   pools 36 points, so a level comes from the whole curve rather than from the
   two samples that happen to bracket the target.
3. **The delivered phase disagreed with the phase the fits assume.**
   :func:`calibration_module.phase.phi_half` takes ``phi/2 = asin(sqrt(v))``,
   i.e. that the commanded ``v`` *is* ``sin^2(Delta/2)``.  Interpolating raw
   samples between an argmin and an argmax does not make that true: on the 0903
   channels the retardance actually delivered ran up to 15 deg from the assumed
   value, against the +/-1 deg step 7 quotes for ``dPhi_comb``.

Inverting this model instead makes point 3 an identity.  ``level_for(v)`` solves
``sin^2(Delta/2) = v`` for ``Delta = 2 asin(sqrt(v))`` -- which is exactly
``2 * phi_half(v)`` -- and then inverts ``Delta(L)``.  The amplitude the encoder
delivers and the phase steps 6/7/8 assume now come from one fit.

Note where the nonlinearity is and is not.  ``v -> Delta = 2 asin(sqrt(v))`` is
the *definition* of what a commanded ``v`` means, and it is untouched by any of
this; ``phi_half`` stays exactly right.  The curvature is in ``Delta(L)``, the
panel's own level-to-phase response, so it changes only which grayscale is
written to reach a given ``v``.  Steps 6/7/8 need no change -- they consume
``level_for`` and a phase model that never depended on ``Delta`` being linear.

Why a curvature term
--------------------
The 0903 Step-3b (OSA) sweeps did not support one: residuals were white --
median lag-1 autocorrelation 0.095, sign runs on the white-noise expectation
(17 vs 19) -- and their 2-3% rms was single-shot sweep noise, not model error.
This docstring said that if a finer sweep ever resolved a real nonlinearity,
this was the place to add it.  The 0907 Step-3c (DAQ) sweep did:

* the linear model's residual is a clean sinusoid, in phase on all 12 channels,
  far above the scatter about it -- structure, not noise;
* one quadratic term takes rms from 1.25% of contrast to 0.23%, a 5.5x gain,
  and every channel improves by 4.8-6.1x;
* the fitted curvature agrees across channels that were fitted independently
  and seeded at zero -- -0.21 rad at the sweep edge, spread only -0.186..-0.241,
  never changing sign.  Twelve independent fits do not agree that closely on a
  free parameter unless it is measuring something.

Concretely the panel's response is sublinear: on the 0907 channels the local
rate falls from ~7.8 mrad/level near extinction to ~5.6 near full scale.
Encoding that curve with a linear ``Delta`` over-delivers by up to +2.4% of full
scale, peaking near ``v = 0.65``, with the same sign on every channel.

A cubic is deliberately not offered.  The quadratic is what the data resolves;
past that the residual is at the sweep's noise and more parameters would fit it.

Bad cells
---------
The fit is robust twice over, because once was not enough.  A soft-L1 loss
down-weights points that disagree with the curve, and then :func:`fit_transfer_curve`
drops what is still past ``clip`` robust sigmas and refits without it.

The second stage exists because of 0907 channel 11.  Four adjacent DAQ cells
(levels 845..890) read ~25x the rest of the curve, and the soft-L1 loss alone
did not save the fit: contrast collapsed to 60% of its neighbours', the residual
came out at 824% of contrast, and the encoding window landed at 417..573 against
399..887 on the eleven channels either side.  Because ``save_calibration_result``
fits once at write time and freezes the result, that fit is what every later
step 6, 7 and 8 run against that file would have encoded channel 11 with -- a
channel driven badly wrong, from a JSON that looks entirely normal.  Dropping
the four cells recovers rms 0.18% of contrast and a window in family.

The threshold is judged on the *final* model, curvature included, against a
MAD-based sigma with a floor.  Both details matter and both are in the
constants: clipping on the linear stage would read a curved sweep's smooth
model mismatch as outliers at the ends, and an unfloored MAD collapses on a
curve the model fits almost exactly, at which point every point is thousands of
"sigma" out.  Clipping stops if it wants more than a fifth of the sweep -- that
is a channel that is not sin^2, and deleting the disagreement would hide it.
``n_clipped`` records what was dropped, so a stored fit says whether it needed
this.

Branch convention
-----------------
``sin^2`` is periodic and even, so the raw fit leaves ``Delta`` on an arbitrary
branch and sign.  :func:`fit_transfer_curve` normalizes both: ``Delta`` is made
increasing across the sweep (the model is invariant under negating every
coefficient), and ``phase_offset`` is folded by whole periods so ``Delta = 0``
lands at the darkest swept level.  The encoding window is then always ``Delta in
[0, pi]``, i.e. levels ``off_level..on_level``, and the stored parameters are
self-contained.

A quadratic ``Delta`` turns over at ``turning_level``, beyond which it is no
longer invertible.  The fitter rejects a curvature solution that turns inside
the swept range (falling back to linear), and :attr:`TransferFit.turns_in_panel`
reports the case where the vertex lands inside the panel's 0..1023 but outside
the sweep -- fine for encoding, which never leaves ``off_level..on_level``, but
worth seeing.

    Two stages.  The 4-parameter linear-``Delta`` model is fitted first, and
    then -- with ``curvature`` on, the default -- refitted with the quadratic
    ``Delta`` term seeded from it at zero.  Seeding this way matters: the
    curvature is a small correction on a periodic model, and a cold start on
    five parameters lands on the wrong branch often enough to be a problem.

    The refinement is kept only if it earns its parameter: it must converge,
    improve the rms, and leave ``Delta`` monotonic across the whole swept range
    (a parabola that turns over inside the sweep is not a transfer curve).
    Otherwise the linear fit is returned with ``phase_curv = 0.0`` -- which is
    also what happens when there are too few points for five parameters.  So
    ``phase_curv == 0.0`` exactly means "no curvature in effect", and
    ``curvature=False`` reproduces the original 4-parameter behaviour.

    Constrained, not free-running: ``floor >= 0`` because a normalized power
    cannot be negative (unconstrained, all ten 0903 channels want a slightly
    negative floor -- the reference normalization over-subtracts by ~1%), and
    ``contrast >= 0``.  Pinning the floor at zero where the fit wants to go
    below it is also what keeps ``v -> Delta`` honest for the downstream phase
    model, which has no floor term to absorb it.

    ``robust`` uses a soft-L1 loss so one spiked cell cannot drag the curve --
    the failure mode this whole module exists to fix.  Turn it off for a plain
    least-squares fit.

    ``clip`` then removes what the robust loss only down-weights.  Points whose
    residual exceeds ``clip`` robust sigmas (MAD-based, so a spike cannot
    inflate the threshold it is judged against) are dropped and the curve is
    refitted without them, repeating until nothing more is found.  Down-weighting
    alone is not enough at this scale: on the 0907 run four latched DAQ cells on
    channel 11 survived the soft-L1 loss and left a fit with an rms of 824% of
    contrast and an encoding window of 417..573 instead of 399..887 -- a channel
    that would have been driven badly wrong by every step-6/7/8 run reading that
    file.  Dropping them recovers rms 0.18% and a window in line with the other
    eleven channels.  The count is kept in ``n_clipped`` so a stored fit says so.

    The sigma is judged against the *final* model, curvature included: a
    quadratic-vs-linear mismatch is smooth structure, not noise, and clipping on
    the linear stage would trim the ends of a perfectly good curved sweep.  Set
    ``clip=0`` to fit every finite point.

    Raises :class:`TransferFitError` if there is nothing to fit or the linear
    stage will not converge.  There is deliberately no polynomial fallback for
    the *shape*: a channel whose transfer curve is not sin^2 is a channel to
    investigate, not to silently encode against a curve with no phase meaning.
    The curvature term is not that -- it stays inside ``Delta``, so ``v`` still
    means ``sin^2(Delta/2)`` exactly and the phase identity is preserved.

    scale is floored at :data:`_CLIP_MIN_SIGMA_FRAC` of the fitted contrast,

    fits almost exactly (see the constant).

    Every accepted pass refits from scratch on the survivors rather than
    updating in place, so the returned fit -- including ``n_used``, ``rms`` and

    Bails out, keeping whatever the last accepted pass produced, when the clip

    would survive to fit, or when the refit fails.  Those are all "this is not a
    curve with a few bad cells" and the honest answer is the unclipped fit with
    its large rms visible, not a tidy fit of whatever agreed with itself.

    Know the limit: this can only remove outliers the fit disagrees with.  If
    the bad points are numerous or coherent enough to capture the fit, their
    residuals are small and no threshold finds them -- four adjacent cells at
    twice full scale drag the synthetic sweep's ``on_level`` past 1600 and are
    clipped at no sigma at all, while lowering the threshold only starts
    deleting the good points instead.  What catches that case is the absurd
