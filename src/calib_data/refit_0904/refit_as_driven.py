"""Re-fit the 0904 run against what the SLM was ACTUALLY driven to.

The 0904 run encoded with ``method="interp"``: a requested value ``v`` was
turned into a grayscale level by interpolating the measured step-3b sweep.  The
fitted sin^2 transfer model says that level did not deliver ``v`` -- it
delivered ``sin^2(Delta(L)/2)`` for the level's fitted retardance.  On pair 4's
x channel the sweep has a noise spike at level 770 that ``argmax`` took as full
scale, so a commanded ``x = 1.0`` wrote level 770 and delivered 0.928.

This harness replays that.  For every commanded value in the 0904 measurement
CSVs it recovers the integer level the run wrote and reads the delivered value
off the fitted curve::

    v_cmd --level_for_interp--> L --fit.retardance--> Delta --sin^2(Delta/2)--> v_driven

The conversion is exact, not approximate: none of steps 6/7/8 passes a
``col_ratio``, so a channel's whole band sat at ONE integer level, and
``level_for_interp`` replays bit-for-bit from the step-3b JSON.

WHAT THIS IS AND IS NOT
-----------------------
This is a systematic-error correction of an existing run: the voltages are
untouched, only the x/w axis is relabelled.  It is NOT a re-run.  A genuinely
fit-encoded run would place its points at DIFFERENT levels -- pair 4's x = 1.0
would go to level 850, which that sweep never sampled on that channel -- so
this says nothing about what the panel does there.  Only hardware does.

It also cannot, on its own, show that the fitted encoding is better: it uses
the fit as truth to relabel, so "the refit gives a nicer eta" would be
circular.  The falsifiable part is the INTERNAL CONSISTENCY checks, which
compare independent measurements against each other and not against the fit:

  * step 6's product check -- (1, 0.25) vs (0.5, 0.5), commanded identical,
    delivered differing by up to 3.8%
  * step 6's intercept check -- the difference line's beta0 vs the
    independently measured a_x
  * step 7's per-point pulls
  * step 8's prediction residual, the strongest, since it predicts from the
    step-6 + step-7 parameters against measurements that fed neither

A wrong relabelling makes those WORSE.  That is what to read the outputs on.

THE STEP MODULES ARE NOT MODIFIED
---------------------------------
Everything here either reuses a step function unchanged, subclasses one of its
types, or rebinds a module-level constant for the duration of the run.  Two
pieces of step 6 cannot be reused as-is and are reimplemented below:

  * ``Level``'s block classification tests literal values (``x == 1.0``,
    ``x == 0.0``).  Delivered values are 0.928 and 0.0007, so every level would
    reclassify and the fit would collapse.  :class:`DrivenLevel` keeps the
    COMMANDED pair as the level's identity -- block, cross line, fit window,
    verification flag -- while ``x``/``w`` carry what was delivered.  The fit
    window in particular stays keyed on the commanded w: which levels to trust
    is a design choice about the grid, not a property of where they landed.

  * ``fit_difference`` builds its design as ``[w, 1]``, i.e. it hardcodes
    ``x == 1`` on the cross line, so on pair 4 it would return ``eta^2 * 0.928``.
    :func:`fit_difference_driven` uses ``[x*w, x]``, which is the same model
    with that assumption lifted and reduces to ``[w, 1]`` exactly when x = 1.

Everything else -- ``fit_background`` (already general in x and w),
``design_bg``, ``grad_bg_w``, ``PairV2Fit``, ``report``, ``save_combined_json``,
all of step 7's fit, all of step 8's ``compare`` -- is the step module's own.
