"""Draft: step 6 v2's PRODUCT-only check, on its own short grid.

    python src/drafts/calib_step6_verify.py             # measure, then check
    python src/drafts/calib_step6_verify.py --meas      # raw CSV only, no check
    python src/drafts/calib_step6_verify.py some.csv    # re-check a CSV offline

Why this exists
---------------
:mod:`calib_step6_v2` prints its verification with every fit, but getting it
costs the whole 37-acquisition grid (~5.6 min/pair) because the checks ride
along with the eta fit.  When the thing under investigation IS a check -- the
product split -- that is the wrong ratio: 31 of those acquisitions serve only an
eta the check does not need.

This draft keeps the check and drops the estimator.  What it measures:

* the **background block** -- dark, x-only, w-only: the five levels
  ``fit_background`` needs, at step 6's own repeat counts.  These are neither
  optional nor reusable from an earlier run.  The check subtracts a *fitted*
  single-beam background from each point, so a background carried over from
  another day would put that day's drift straight into the residue difference,
  which is precisely the quantity being measured.
* the **check levels**, derived from :data:`PRODUCT_CHECKS` -- add a group and
  its levels are measured automatically; there is no second list to keep in step
  with it.

What it does NOT do
-------------------
Step 6's other verification -- the intercept identity ``beta0 = a_x (+ q_x)`` --
needs ``beta0``, which exists only once the cross line has been fitted.  It is
inseparable from the estimator, as is the top-drive compression diagnostic, so
neither is here.  Run :mod:`calib_step6_v2` for those.

The report -- printed and drawn
-------------------------------
One PNG per pair, and it shows one quantity: the **TPA residue**
``Y(x, w) - Bhat(x, w)``, i.e. what is left of each check level once the fitted
single-beam background is subtracted.  Every member of a group shares one
``x*w``, so the model says those residues are the same number measured several
ways; the left panel plots them against the drive split and the right panel
grades every pairwise difference in sigma.  Nothing else is drawn -- the
background block, the level table and the repeat scatter are printed, because
they are inputs to the subtraction rather than the thing under test.

How it borrows
--------------
The measurement path, the sigma model, ``fit_background`` and ``verify_product``
are IMPORTED from ``calib_step6_v2`` -- by path, the way
``src/drafts/calib_step6-8_v2.py`` imports the steps -- and the config below is
pushed into it before anything runs.  Nothing is reimplemented, so a split this
script reports is a split step 6 would report on the same rows, which is the
only thing that makes a shortened grid worth trusting.

:data:`~calib_step6_v2.FIT_Q` is inherited rather than redeclared, for the same
reason: the background subtracted here has to be the background subtracted
there.

The CSV keeps step 6's column layout, so ``load_meas_csv`` reads it back.  It
will NOT re-fit under ``calib_step6_v2 <csv>``: there is no cross line in it and
the slope fit correctly refuses it.
